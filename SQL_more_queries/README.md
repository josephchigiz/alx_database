# MySQL
## What is data?
Data is a collection of raw facts, related to the object in consideration.  

As we have seen previously in Python, there are different types of data:  

- Strings
- Integer
- Decimal (whole point, precision)
- Float
- Double 

## Databases
A **database** is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.  

Since most databases carry large amounts of data, managing the data manually may not be easy or possible.  
In this case a **database management system** *(DBMS)* is used.  

These data management systems manage the **CRUD** operations which are; creating, reading, updating and deleting data.

### Types of DBMS  
There are different **DBMS** types which offer different functions and are used for different purposes.  
They include:  

- Hierarchial DBMS -> Employs parent-child rel of storing data
- Network DBMS -> Supports many to many relations
- Relational DBMS -> Does not support many to many relation. Has predefined relationships they can support.
- Object oriented DBMS -> Supports storage of new data types. Data to be stored are in the form of objects e,g age, gender

#### Relational DBMS
This is the most-widely used DBMS and saves data in table formats. It has two main components:  

- Columns - Attributes, Properties, Members
- Rows - Records

### SQL Domain Specific Language  
**Structured Query Language (SQL)** -> Standard language for dealing with relational databases.  

- DML - *Data Modification Language* is a set of commands that deal with manipulation of data present in the database.:`SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, UPDATE, DELETE`  
- DDL - *Data Definition Language* is made up of commands that are used to define the database: `CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE, COMMENT, RENAME`  
- DCL - *Data Control Language* this language deals with permissions, rights and other controls of the databases: `GRANT, INVOKE`
- TCL - *Transaction Control Language* deals with commands that deal with transaction events of the databases.  

There is so much more to MySQL. So hurry, get resources and build databases.

**Happy Coding!** ðŸ˜‰
